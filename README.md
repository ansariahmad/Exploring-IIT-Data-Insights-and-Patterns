# IIT Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is part of the course "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas" offered by [Jovian.ml](https://jovian.com/). The course is free of cost and available to anyone interested in learning data analysis with Python.

## Introduction

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) dataset. The main objective was to gain insights and extract meaningful information from the data. The analysis involved various tasks, including data preparation, feature creation, calculating descriptive statistics, identifying outliers, and discovering patterns within the dataset.

## Course: Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas

The "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas" course provided a comprehensive introduction to data analysis using Python. Through a series of interactive lessons and hands-on assignments, I learned various techniques and tools for data manipulation, visualization, and exploratory analysis. The course was hosted on [Jovian.ml](https://jovian.com/), a platform for collaborative data science.

## Dataset:
The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/iit-admissions-dataset).

## Project Tasks

The project encompassed the following tasks:

1. Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure it was suitable for analysis.

2. Feature Creation: Creating new features from existing data to enhance analysis.

3. Calculating Descriptive Statistics: Computing the mean and median of numerical columns to understand central tendencies.

4. Outlier Detection: Identifying outliers in the data that deviate significantly from the majority.

5. Pattern Discovery: Exploring the dataset for recurring patterns and trends.

## Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn
